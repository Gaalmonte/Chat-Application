# React & Firebase Realtime Chat Room
In this project I will be practicing and exercising my React skills while also learning Firebase. 

## Goal
By the end of this project I will deploy it and include the link on the bottom of this readme. You should be able to chat with anyone that joins. There will be rules in order to prevent the chat room from shutting down due to spam, or to mute someone with vulgar language.
